  "LongDescription": "This will patch your game to randomly remove excess food stuff lying around (supposedly) deserted locations. The patch will locate every food item in a cell and then randomly decide if it should be removed or left in place. The chance that it will be removed is configurable through config files. By default the less a location is populated, the higher the chance food will be removed, so drauger dungeons will have a very high chance of food removal, while farmhouses will have a very low chance.\r\n",
